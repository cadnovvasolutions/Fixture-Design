# 4-Wheeler Suspension Fixture Design (2D & 3D)

This project showcases the design of a fixture used for the suspension system of a 4-wheeler. The fixture is designed and modeled in **SolidWorks** for the purpose of holding suspension components in place during testing or assembly processes. The design includes both 2D schematics and 3D models of the fixture structure.

## Project Overview

The fixture is designed to hold the suspension components securely while enabling precise alignment and positioning during the testing phase. This ensures that the suspension system undergoes realistic and repeatable testing for performance evaluations. The project includes:

- **2D Design**: Schematic drawings for the fixture layout.
- **3D Design**: Detailed 3D models of the fixture assembly with integrated components for holding and securing suspension parts.

The fixture is modeled with an emphasis on functionality, ease of use, and durability.

## Features

- 2D schematic drawings of the fixture layout.
- 3D model of the complete fixture assembly.
- Detailed component modeling (e.g., frame, support posts, alignment features).
- Optimized design for stable positioning and secure holding of suspension parts.

## Technologies Used

- **SolidWorks**: Used for creating both 2D and 3D designs of the fixture.
- **SolidWorks Simulation**: Optional, for evaluating the fixture's performance under loading conditions (e.g., stress analysis).
