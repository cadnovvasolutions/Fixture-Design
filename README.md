# Fixture Design (2D & 3D)

This project showcases the design of a fixture used for holding and positioning components during testing or assembly processes. The fixture is designed and modeled in **SolidWorks** to ensure stability and precision during operations.

## Project Overview

The fixture is designed to securely hold parts in place, ensuring accurate alignment and positioning. This is crucial for effective testing and assembly of components. The project includes:

- **2D Design**: Schematic drawings for the fixture layout.
- **3D Design**: Detailed 3D models of the fixture assembly with integrated components for holding and securing parts.

The fixture is optimized for functionality, durability, and ease of use.

## Features

- 2D schematic drawings of the fixture layout.
- 3D model of the complete fixture assembly.
- Detailed component modeling (e.g., frame, support posts, alignment features).
- Optimized design for stable positioning and secure holding of components.

## Technologies Used

- **SolidWorks**: Used for creating both 2D and 3D designs of the fixture.
- **SolidWorks Simulation**: Optional, for evaluating the fixture's performance under loading conditions (e.g., stress analysis).
